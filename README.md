3. With the comments you had placed a lot of them can not be applied in this version since no marks for them , 
in a sense i will just talk about the functions and they are changes in this new version with the user-interface.
The search function from part 2 was not functioning at a 100 percent where i could only display the last values entered by the user 
but now the search function is working at a 100 percent where it could be searched and be affected by the users choice's and display the changes,
than a other change was the steps with the check boxes where are linked by the recipe name.
